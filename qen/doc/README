QEN README


Reason

	KDE - and its associated applications - is the best piece of software that I've ever used.  The fact that it doesn't cost any money is nothing short of ridiculous.

	After using KDE for a couple of years, I've been feeling guilty about not contributing my programming skills (or lack thereof) to the open-source community.  Quamachi is my second step towards silencing this feeling of guilt.


Purpose

	QEN is a eGroupWare notifier GUI, residing in the System Tray.

	Great thanks to Quamachi project.

	For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt.  If you encounter any problems, see ISSUES.txt and send me an email if necessary.
