rpmorphan finds "orphaned" packages on your system. It determines which packages have no other packages depending on their installation, and shows you a list of these packages. It is clone of deborphan debian software for rpm packages.

It will try to help you to remove unused packages, for exemple :
- after a distribution upgrade
- when you want to suppress packages after some tests

for a quick start, try the following command
rpmorphan --gui --all
