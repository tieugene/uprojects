Quamachi ISSUES



All:


Linux:

	TunCfg
		See the 'TunCfg' section of 'INSTALL.txt'

	Hamachi
		See the 'TunCfg' and 'Hamachi' sections of 'INSTALL.txt'
		tap: bad response
			Remove the "~/.hamachi/" dir and run "hamachi-init -n <nickname>" (again)
		tap: connect() failed
			Restart "tuncfg"
		Logging in ... failed
			Add "/sbin" to yours and root's $PATH statement; re-login to KDE
			Try removing the "~/.hamachi/" dir and run "hamachi-init -n <nickname>" (again)

	Qt
		Bug: 4.2.1: In the 'Qt4 Configuration' program, setting 'Interface --> GUI Effects --> Menu Effect' to 'Animate' can cause an error.  To prevent this, try setting 'Menu Effect' to 'Fade' instead.
			Fix: Please use only Qt >= 4.2.2 with Quamachi.
